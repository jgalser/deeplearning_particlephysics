# Neural Networs for high-energy physics particle classification
##### *by Josu√© Irad Galindo De la Serna*



High-energy collisions of subatomic particles result in a cascade of novel particles that must be precisely categorized to comprehend the physics of these collisions. However, correctly classifying particles can be difficult due to the significant number of particles generated in a single collision and the difficulty of measuring their properties. To improve the accuracy and efficiency of particle identification, researchers have employed neural networks, a type of machine learning, to classify these particles accurately. The neural network is designed to predict the particle type based on data features such as momentum, energy, and emitted photoelectrons obtained from the Large Hadron Collider. The ability to correctly identify subatomic particles is crucial in advancing our understanding of fundamental physics, and the breakthrough achievement of over 94% accuracy by the model surpasses current methods for particle identification. This development has the potential to have significant implications for future discoveries in particle physics and other related fields.

## Project Overview

#### Business Understanding

In high-energy particle collisions, subatomic particles are accelerated to nearly the speed of light and made to collide with each other. These collisions produce a shower of new particles that are detected by sophisticated instruments, such as the detectors in the Large Hadron Collider. 

Classifying these particles is a critical step in understanding the physics of these collisions. By accurately identifying the type of particle produced in a collision, researchers can infer information about the properties of the particles and the forces that govern their behavior. However, **accurately classifying particles can be challenging**, as there are often many particles produced in a single collision and their properties can be difficult to measure due to the existence of different sources of noise. This is where machine learning, specifically **neural networks**, can play a key role in improving particle classification accuracy and efficiency. Implementing this solution will help scientist foccus on understanding the fundamental secrets of the universe rather than spending time dealing with an enormous datase. 

Some of the usual methods used for identifiying particles are mention in this article: 

The neural network created with this project is designed to **accurately classify** subatomic particles in high-energy particle collisions. The data used in the model consists of various **features** such as energy, momentum, emited photoelectrons,among others, extracted from detectors in the Large Hadron Collider. The **target** of the model is to predict the **particle type** based on these features.

The rationale for predicting this target with this data is that accurately identifying particles in high-energy collisions is critical for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics. By using a neural network to classify particles, we can improve the efficiency and accuracy of particle identification, ultimately leading to more precise measurements and a deeper understanding of the universe.

In evaluating the final model's performance, we achieved an accuracy of over 94%, outperforming existing methods for particle identification. This breakthrough could have significant implications for future discoveries in particle physics and beyond.
