# Neural Networs for high-energy physics particle classification
### Final Capstone AI Academy project
#### by Josu√© Irad Galindo De la Serna

High energy particle collisions produce a vast amount of complex data that can only be analyzed with sophisticated techniques. Neural networks are at the forefront of this analysis, providing a powerful tool for classifying subatomic particles based on their properties. By accurately categorizing particles, we can significantly reduce the time taken for analysis of a complex dataset. This way phisicists can foccus on better understanding the fundamental forces that govern our universe rather than wasting time and efford in obsolete statistical methods for classifiying particles. With the ability to process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, neural networks are a critical tool in advancing our understanding of particle physics and unlocking the mysteries of the universe.
